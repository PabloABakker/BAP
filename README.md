This repository is created for the TU DELFT Bsc Final Project, spcifically for the subgroup DelFly control using sparse reinforcement learning techniques.
The main objective was to create a controller for a flapping wing drone (DelFly) using Reinforcement Learning, distill the knowledge using a system identification technique : SINDy.
This was done for the following reasons: the sindy algorithmn produces sparse interpretable equations, which is for obvious reasons better for implementation. Furthermore we extended the applications of the sindy algorithmn to encorporate hardare efficient objectives.

## How to install dependencies and compile the code?

- Make sure you are using is Visual Studio Code as the IDE 
- pip install -r requirements.txt
